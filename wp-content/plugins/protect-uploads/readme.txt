Protect your uploads directory to people who want to browse it. Avoid browsing of your uploads directory by adding a htaccess or index.php file.

== Description ==

The uploads directory is where the files of the WordPress library are stored. Unfortunelty, this directory is not protected. A person who wants to see all your library could list it instantly going to : http://yourwebsite/wp-content/uploads . This plugin will hide the content by adding an index.php file on the root of your uploads directory or by setting an htaccess which will return a 403 error (Forbidden Access).

* Depending on your server setting, the htaccess option could be disabled.

Available languages :

* English
* Français
* Español
* Italian (thanks to Marko97)
